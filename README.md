# create-nextjs-boilerplate

`create-nextjs-boilerplate` is a command-line tool that helps you quickly generate a new Next.js project with a pre-configured authentication boilerplate. It's designed to make it easy to get started with a Next.js app that includes authentication setup, so you can focus on building your app rather than spending time on configuration.

## Features

- **Quick Setup**: Create a Next.js project with authentication support(both OAuth Login And Custom Credentials Provider by AuthJS) in one simple command.
- **Pre-configured Auth**: Ready-to-use boilerplate for user authentication using Next.js along with saving the user in Database (here used MongoDB).
- **CLI Tool**: Easily generate your Next.js app directly from the command line with `npx`.

## Installation

You can use the `create-nextjs-boilerplate` CLI tool directly via `npx`, which allows you to execute the command without needing to install anything globally.

### To create a new project, run:

```bash
npx create-nextjs-boilerplate <project-name>

```

## Usage
Once the project is created, navigate to the newly created project folder:

```bash
cd <project-name>
```

## Install the required dependencies:

```bash

npm install
```
Run the development server:

```bash

npm run dev
```
You can now start building your app with the pre-configured authentication system.
